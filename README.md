# agent-org

An AI agent organisation as a tool: rows, claims, the board, the merge queue and the wake gate, run against the repository it is installed in.

## Install

`agent-org` is published to no registry. A project takes it as a git dependency pinned to a release tag, with `typescript` beside it:

```bash
pnpm add -D typescript "github:a11ign/agent-org#semver:^0.1.0"
pnpm exec agent-org <command> [args]
```

`agent-org` with no command, or a name that is not a command, refuses and lists the commands. There is no default command. A command is the
name a project's `package.json` script used (`row-file`, `pr:open`, `board:settle`), and `src/commands.mjs` is the table.

## The project is the repository you run it in

The tool reads `.agent-org/project.json` of the project it serves, and never answers with another project's values. Which project that is:

| layout | `$AGENT_ORG_HOST` unset | `$AGENT_ORG_HOST` set |
|---|---|---|
| installed (`node_modules/agent-org`) | the git repository the command is run in; REFUSED naming `.agent-org/project.json` and the directory looked in if it holds none | the host file's primary project |
| monorepo (`packages/agent-org/src`) | the repository root | the host file's primary project |
| the tool's own checkout | REFUSED naming `AGENT_ORG_HOST` | the host file's primary project |

## What an install holds

`src/` (the programs and their data, without `*.test.*`), `host/` (the unit templates `host:install` reads), `LICENSE`, `README.md` and
`package.json`. The tests are not shipped: they read the project's tree and run in this repository's CI.

`typescript` is a peer dependency, resolved from the project's directory first and the tool's own tree second, so the tool parses the project's code
with the project's compiler. Tested on Node 22.22.1.

## Source is TypeScript

**A new source file is `.ts`, and a `.mjs` you touch may convert in the same pull request** (ADR 0043, a11ign/a11ign#3550). `src/packaging/mjs-source-count.test.ts` pins how
many `.mjs` source files there are and fails when the count RISES; a pull request that converts one lowers the pin in the same diff, so the pin is the progress report.
The mapping from `@ts-check` JSDoc to types is in the ADR's table.

**One limit, until the tool is built rather than run from source:** a `.ts` that a shipped command imports does not load under the host's `node` (22.22.1 is built without
TypeScript support, and node does not strip types under `node_modules`). So a new source file is `.ts`, unless a shipped command imports it; then raise the pin in this diff and say why.
Convert only files that run under `tsx` (tests, test support, CI and dev tools): `src/messaging/fake-provider.ts` is the first, and a file a command reaches stays `.mjs`.

## Releases

**A tag is the release.** `v<version>` on this repository, with a GitHub Release carrying the `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and nothing is published to a registry. **A tag is
never moved or deleted once a project can have pinned it**: a moved tag changes what a pinned project gets, so a mistake is fixed by the next version.

A release starts itself, on the merge that carries a changeset, and no pull request stands between the merge and the tag (a11ign/a11ign#3134, #3187); nobody dispatches anything:

1. A pull request that changes what a project gets carries a changeset (`pnpm run changeset add`). Merge it.
2. On that push to `main`, **release** (a call of a11ign/toolchain's shared `release-per-merge.yml`, pinned by sha, `kind: tag`) waits for `gate` to have succeeded on that sha, then reads which changesets the last tag already consumed (the ones its commit deleted
   from its parent). If any other is pending it builds a **release commit** on top of the merge, carrying the last tag's version and `CHANGELOG.md` with `changeset version`
   run over the unreleased changesets, and pushes it as the tag `v<version>` with a Release carrying the changelog entry. The release commit is on no branch, so nothing is
   written to `main`, and nothing else is needed: no pull request per release, no token beyond the job's own. It refuses if `CHANGELOG.md` has no entry for the version or the
   remote's tags cannot be read, never forces the push, and holds `contents: write` and nothing else.
3. **`main`'s `package.json` version and `CHANGELOG.md` lag the last tag**, and are left to: a project pins the tag's tree, which holds both, and the next version is computed
   from the tag. A later merge with no unreleased changeset cuts nothing, and the next one that carries a changeset is a different, later tag.

The tag is what reaches the running org: the host that runs the org runs the newest `vX.Y.Z` tag (`update-tool` checks it out), and `host.json`'s `toolVersion` pins one tag
instead, which is the whole of a rollback. A merge with a changeset is live about nine minutes after it lands (measured from the tag history on a11ign/a11ign#3443), and a merge
with no changeset is never tagged and so never live. A release therefore changes what a project's CI installs and what the running org does.

A project bumps its pin by editing the range in its `package.json` (`github:a11ign/agent-org#semver:^0.1.0`) in an ordinary dependency pull request and reading the
changelog it links. While the version is `0.x`, `^0.1.0` takes patches only, so a `minor` is the bump a project opts into.
